This was my first project after learning to code in fall of 2023. The project given to us was to create a program that would incorperate a aspects of our field of interest. My field of interest is robotics 
to which my teacher recomended I look into mission-based programming. This is the example that was produced from my 3 week research into programmed mazes using python. While I have revisited it after gaining
more experience, I can say that I learned a lot from the concepts this project taught me.
